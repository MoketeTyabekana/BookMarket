# BookStore
This is an MVC web application.
Book store created for students as platform that allows them to sell their second hand text books and also gives them an option to rent a book from us.
A student can be a seller,buyer and a renter.
By default everyone who registers into our sistem is a buyer, but if you want to sell or rent a text book,you have to register and apply, 
then wait for approval from the system administrators.If you are approved then you can sell or rent a book.If you are not approved the a feedback will be send to you to why you were not approved, Then you can re-apply again.
